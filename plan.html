<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal for the 'cossieplay' website is essentially to increase local customer traffic in store. Hopefully increasing the money that 'cossieplay' makes.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success of the website will be evaluated by monitoring the in store customer traffic and/or the ammount of money the store is making.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>As stated in the client brief the target audience is generally going to be males/females between the ages 15-20 (new customers) and 35-50. (most frequent customer age) Generally the target audience for any cosplay is geeky.</p>
<p>In order to appeal to this target audience the website should show various video game/sci fi/fantasy themes. Seing as the target audience will range from 15-50, both old (eg. zelda, mario) and new (eg. WoW, League of Legends) themes should be used. </p>
